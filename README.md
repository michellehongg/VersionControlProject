This code asks for the name and age and prints them out
Rachel Soubier & Michelle Hong

Our projects takes in inputs from the user.

It first asks for the name of the user and prints out their name in the following String "Your name is: (name)"
It then asks for the age of the user and prints out their age in the following Stirng "Your age is: (age)"
It finally asks for the user to enter a number from 1 through 10 and keeps asking for the user to enter a number to add to a total sum until the counter reaches a number that is larger than the intial number that was entered.
It will print out a String that says "(name), your sum is (sum)".

All the user has to do to run this file is download it onto their system, open the file, and hit run, and the program will promptly ask for the user to enter their inputs.

If the user would like to contribute to the program, they could add other prompts that ask the user to enter in input values that print out a certain String at the end.
